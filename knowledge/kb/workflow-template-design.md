# Template Design in Labelz (Layout + Branding + Fields)

A **Template Design** is where you build the *actual label layout*—how it will look when printed on a tag, sticker, pouch label, or carton label.

You usually do this once, then reuse the template to generate labels (single or bulk) for different products and batches.

---

## What a good template design achieves

A good template design is:
- **Print-ready** (no cut-offs, readable text, clean margins)
- **Brand-consistent** (logo, typography, colors)
- **Reusable** (fields are structured so generation is quick)
- **Scannable** (barcodes/QR codes work in real life)

---

## What you can add in a Template Design

### 1) Branding elements
- Brand name
- Logo
- Taglines or marketing text
- Brand colors (where applicable)

**Best practice:** Use branding consistently across templates so all labels “look like your brand”.

---

### 2) Product and packaging fields (dynamic data)
Fields are placeholders that change per label:
- Product name
- SKU / product code
- Variant info (size/color)
- Material / composition
- MRP / pricing
- Manufacturing details (if needed)
- Batch / lot number (if needed)
- Net quantity / weight (if needed)
- Dates (MFD / EXP if applicable)

**Best practice:** Keep field names consistent across templates (example: always use `sku` not sometimes `SKU_CODE`).

---

### 3) Codes for scanning (barcode / QR)
Labelz supports adding codes like:
- **Barcode**
- **QR Code**
- **Serialized IDs** (unique codes per generated label)

**Best practice for scanning:**
- Don’t place codes too close to the edge
- Keep enough “white space” around the barcode/QR
- Test scan after printing (always)

---

## How to design a template (recommended workflow)

### Step 1 — Start with the right label type and size
Choose a size/layout that matches your real-world label:
- Hang tags (fashion)
- Stickers for pouches/bottles
- Box labels
- Carton/outer packaging labels

If you’re unsure, start with a close guess and validate via test print.

---

### Step 2 — Add the required fields first
Before making it pretty, make sure it’s complete.

Examples:

#### Fashion / Footwear (common)
- Brand
- SKU
- Product name
- Size
- MRP
- Care / material (if required)

#### Beauty / Cosmetics (common)
- Product name + variant/shade
- Net qty
- MRP
- Batch
- MFD/EXP (or best before)
- Barcode/QR (if used)

#### Food / Consumables (common)
- Net weight
- Batch
- MFD/EXP
- MRP
- Barcode/QR (if used)

---

### Step 3 — Build the layout
- Place brand elements (logo + name)
- Arrange fields in a hierarchy:
  - most important info larger
  - secondary info smaller
- Keep consistent spacing and alignment
- Keep enough margins for printing and cutting

**Print rule:** If it’s near the edge on screen, it may get cut on paper.

---

### Step 4 — Add codes last (barcode/QR)
- Add barcode/QR where it will not be folded, curved, or scratched
- Keep codes at an adequate size
- Ensure enough whitespace around them

---

### Step 5 — Save and test with a single label
Generate a single label with real sample values and test:
- text readability
- alignment and margins
- scannability
- overall look

---

## Print-readiness checklist (use this every time)

### Layout
- [ ] Important text is not too close to the edges
- [ ] Font sizes are readable at the real printed size
- [ ] Spacing is consistent (not cramped)

### Scanning (barcode/QR)
- [ ] Code is large enough to scan
- [ ] Code has sufficient whitespace around it
- [ ] Code is not placed on a curve/fold area (for packaging)

### Branding
- [ ] Logo is clear (not pixelated)
- [ ] Label looks consistent with your other brand assets

---

## Common issues and fixes

### “My label prints cut off”
- Increase padding/margins
- Reduce font size slightly
- Re-check label size vs printer settings

### “Barcode/QR doesn’t scan”
- Increase code size
- Add more whitespace around it
- Print at higher quality
- Ensure no distortion during printing

### “Template works for one SKU but not others”
- Use flexible layout spacing
- Avoid hardcoding values into the design
- Ensure fields cover multiple variants (size/color)
